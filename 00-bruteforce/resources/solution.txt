The login page (?page=signin) does not limit login attempts and transmits credentials via GET.
This allows automated tools to guess passwords without restriction.

Method:
- Python script using requests to perform a dictionary attack on the 'admin' account.

Fix:
- Add timer between or on submissions.
- Block IP addresses after 3-5 failed attempts.
- Enforce strong passwords and implement CAPTCHA to stop automation.
