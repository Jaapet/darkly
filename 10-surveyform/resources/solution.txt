The survey page (?page=survey) relies on client-side HTML attributes (<option value="...">) to define the score.
The server processes the submitted value without verifying if it falls within the allowed range (1-10).

Method:
- Used Developer Tools to inspect the "grade" dropdown menu.
- Edited the value attribute of an option to an arbitrary high number or a specific unauthorized value.
- Submitted the form, bypassing the logic check and forcing the server to accept an impossible score, revealing the flag.

Fix:
- Implement server-side checks to ensure the input is an integer within the expected range.
- Only accept values that match a predefined array of valid options.
