Context:
To discover pages/directories not visible in the UI, I ran dirsearch (web content scanner):
python3 dirsearch.py -u "http://192.168.56.101/"

I identified robots.txt and read it:
curl http://192.168.56.101/robots.txt

It contains Disallow: /.hidden (hidden from crawlers, but still accessible).

Method:

1. Download /.hidden

    mkdir ~/darkly_hidden
    cd ~/darkly_hidden
    wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=1 -e robots=off \
    "http://192.168.56.101/.hidden/"

2. Search for the flag
Once the files are downloaded locally:
grep -R "flag" .

The flag is located at:
http://192.168.56.101/.hidden/whtccjokayshttvxycsvykxcfm/igeemtxnvexvxezqwntmzjltkt/lmpanswobhwcozdqixbowvbrhw/


Fix:
-Don’t put sensitive paths in robots.txt: it is meant for crawling rules, not for “hiding” content.
-If a directory must be private, enforce access controls (authentication + authorization).
-Use strict file permissions.
