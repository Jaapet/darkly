The password recovery page (?page=recover) relies on a hidden HTML input field (<input type="hidden">)
to specify the recipient email address for the reset code.

http://192.168.56.102/?page=recover

Method:
- Used browser Developer Tools to inspect the form and identified a hidden input field named mail
  containing a predefined email address (webmaster@borntosec.com).
- Modified the value attribute of the hidden field to my own email address and submitted the form.
- The server accepted the modified input and displayed the flag (simulating sending the recovery code to the new address).

Fix:
- Never trust sensitive data (like prices, IDs, or emails) submitted via hidden fields (preferably manage it in the backend).
- Retrieve the user's email address directly from the backend database using a provided username, rather than accepting it from the form.
