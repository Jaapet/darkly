The website uses the ?page= parameter to include files
but fails to validate that the requested path is within the intended directory.
This allows an attacker to navigate the server's file system.

http://192.168.56.102/?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

Method:
- Used ../ (parent directory) sequences to navigate
  from the active web folder all the way up to the server root.
- Accessed /etc/passwd, a standard readable Linux file
  containing a list of all system users, proving arbitrary file read access
  (configuration files, source code, passwords).

Fix:
- Use a strict whitelist of allowed filenames (e.g., ['home', 'login', 'contact']).
- Use functions like basename() to strip directory paths from input (folders, slashes, or traversal dots).
