Context:
Browse the page and inspect cookies in the browser.

Method: 
I observed a value that looks like an MD5 hash.
By comparing values, it appears the site likely checks something like: “if the cookie equals MD5('true'), then the user is admin; otherwise, non-admin.”
After replacing the cookie value with the one corresponding to true and reloading the page, access switches to admin.

Fix:
-Store roles/permissions server-side; cookie should be an opaque session ID only.
-Add integrity if data must be client-side: Use a server-secret signature.
-Set cookies: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite (helps, but doesn’t fix integrity).
-Enforce server-side authorization checks on every admin page/action.
