Context:
Find “hidden” resources and highlight a bad security practice (credentials publicly accessible).

Method:
1.Retrieve /whatever
    robots.txt mentions /whatever, so I downloaded the directory recursively:

    mkdir ~/darkly_whatever
    cd ~/darkly_whatever
    wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=1 -e robots=off \
    "http://192.168.56.101/whatever/"


2. Find htpasswd
    I found an htpasswd file containing:
    root:437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49
    This is a username (root) plus an MD5 hash. The corresponding password is: qwerty123@.

3. Admin login
    The “general” login form did not work, but the real admin area is located at: /admin
    Login with: username: root and password: qwerty123@
    --> access granted + flag.

Fix:
-Never expose sensitive files in the webroot (including htpasswd, backups, dumps).
-Protect internal areas with real authentication/authorization (not “hidden” via robots.txt).
-Disable directory listing.
-Store passwords using a modern, suitable hash (e.g., bcrypt/argon2) and enforce strong passwords.
